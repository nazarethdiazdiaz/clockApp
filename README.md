# clockApp
SNHU CS210 clock project

CS 210 Module Eight Journal Reflection 

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project was a clock app. This program was meant to resemble a 12-hour and a 24-hour clock. 
The user was first asked to enter the starting time to set the clock. After that the clock would 
display the time in both 12 and 24-hour time formats. The program would keep asking the 
user to add seconds, minutes, or hours to the time until the user wanted to exit the program. 

What did you do particularly well?
I felt like I did very well with the logic of the program. Being able to solve the changing times of 
the clock, and doing it for both the 12-hour and 24-hour time was difficult to build but feel that I 
delivered the project successfully and efficiently. 

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could have enhanced my code in the main class. Looking back, I feel as if my code was not written in 
the most simple and clear way in the main function. Being able to perhaps add another class could have 
helped with this part. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
I learned many valuable skills from this project. I learned how to write a header file, and work with different files 
in one program. Learning how to write multiple files as well as a header file is crucial to my development as a programmer. 
I learned how to better problem solve writing a program as well. I learned to look at the big problem, and break it 
down into smaller parts. Then solve the smaller parts one by one. 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable by writing it in multiple files. I created a separate 
.cpp file to store all the functions of the program. I also created a header file where you can view the functions 
of the program which are the biggest blueprint.
